# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Just getting the layout sort of how I want it.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle to figure out how to make my things display the way I think they should.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Primairly worked on functionality.

**Thoughts:** Combining CSS variables and SCSS functions seems to not work. I might be able to figure out a workaround.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Finished up styling and layout and worked on improved functionality in setting a random color. Also worked with `@keyframes` for the `shake` animation. The only functionality that's left is the Twitter integration.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is the devil! But I know I need to learn it.

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was trying to use Foundation's `reveal` component to display the Tweet form, but had some issues I couldn't figure out, and decided it wasn't worth the effort at this time.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to also learn React at the same time for this app. Plus, browser security is annoying.

### Day 6: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've been struggling to figure out React. Not giving up just yet, but maybe using Code Pen isn't the best way to learn it. Also, I'm _learning_ how to use Code Pen, too. Figuring out how to do things when you don't have access to all the different files that the documentation wants you to have is frustrating.

### Day 7: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp and learning React while doing so.

**Thoughts:** I've successfully coded over the weekend, which is where I thought I would have had trouble staying committed. This is HUGE for me. Also, React is starting to make sense to me now, after having spent some time going through the docs.

### Day 8: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FreeCodeCamp projects to play with React.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang of what React can do and I'm starting to like it better than Angular. We'll see what I think of it when I use it for a meatier project in the near future.

### Day 9: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through the React: Getting Started and continued work on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Most of what I've learned about React has clicked and I feel confident to implement React into my Weather app. So far, so good.

### Day 10: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some excellent progress on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp. Just about all of the framework and functionality is finished, just need to style it.

**Thoughts:** Still have a bit to go before fully understanding React, but I think I know enough to be dangerous.

### Day 11: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All functionality of the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp is finished! I just need to stylize it.

**Thoughts:** Now that I'm trying to style the app, Flexbox rears its ugly, unexpected head. The fact that this is a React app and all my classes are assigned in my javascript file make matters even more tedious to get an idea of how the app is _actually_ structured.

### Day 12: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on styling the app.

**Thoughts:** I have a hard time visualizing my app and then styling it to what I see in my head.

### Day 13: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Missed a day, but I'm still working on styling the app.

**Thoughts:** Now I'm having a hard time visualizing my app. I really should have started with a layout, then made it dynamic. I instead designed to the data that was available. Now I feel like I'm constantly changing design descisions based on the content that should have been decided on earlier in the process. I'm marking this down as a "lesson learned."

### Day 14: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Yet more styling... I may never finish this app...

**Thoughts:** I've changed the layout _yet again,_ after starting at the mobile level and realized that it doesn't look very good at smaller sizes, _especially_ going between portrait and landscape. I fell like I've really botched the design of this app.

### Day 15: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some different layout ideas.

**Thoughts:** Now that I've redone the layout of the app, I think it'll work on all screens much more effectively. _I need to move past this project!_

### Day 16: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finalized the layout (_finally!_). Need to do some final styling and a couple functionality things and I'm calling it done!

**Thoughts:** With the layout finished, I'm finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Now I've got to figure out how to get the off-canvas element to work. This project has made me realize I was using Foundation for the sake of using Foundation. Maybe I don't need it?

### Day 17: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the styling of app!

**Thoughts:** I've finished this project! Time to move on to other things.

### Day 18: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Well, I thought I was finished with the app yesterday, but then found a few things to troubleshoot on mobile. Those are fixed now, and I'm extremely happy with the results.

**Thoughts:** I only _thought_ I finished the Local Weather app! I made some tweaks to make for a better experience on mobile. Now I'm moving on to the Wikipedia Search app tomorrow.

### Day 19: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the Wikipedia Viewer app from FreeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts:** I'm having issues with CORS and the wikimedia API. I think CORS is implemented on the remote server, so there's nothing I can do about it on my end. I've seen where JSONP can be used instead, so I'm having to learn about that.
