# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Just getting the layout sort of how I want it.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle to figure out how to make my things display the way I think they should.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Primairly worked on functionality.

**Thoughts:** Combining CSS variables and SCSS functions seems to not work. I might be able to figure out a workaround.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Finished up styling and layout and worked on improved functionality in setting a random color. Also worked with `@keyframes` for the `shake` animation. The only functionality that's left is the Twitter integration.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is the devil! But I know I need to learn it.

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was trying to use Foundation's `reveal` component to display the Tweet form, but had some issues I couldn't figure out, and decided it wasn't worth the effort at this time.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to also learn React at the same time for this app. Plus, browser security is annoying.

### Day 6: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've been struggling to figure out React. Not giving up just yet, but maybe using Code Pen isn't the best way to learn it. Also, I'm _learning_ how to use Code Pen, too. Figuring out how to do things when you don't have access to all the different files that the documentation wants you to have is frustrating.

### Day 7: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp and learning React while doing so.

**Thoughts:** I've successfully coded over the weekend, which is where I thought I would have had trouble staying committed. This is HUGE for me. Also, React is starting to make sense to me now, after having spent some time going through the docs.

### Day 8: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FreeCodeCamp projects to play with React.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang of what React can do and I'm starting to like it better than Angular. We'll see what I think of it when I use it for a meatier project in the near future.

### Day 9: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through the React: Getting Started and continued work on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Most of what I've learned about React has clicked and I feel confident to implement React into my Weather app. So far, so good.
