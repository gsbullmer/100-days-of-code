# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Just getting the layout sort of how I want it.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle to figure out how to make my things display the way I think they should.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Primairly worked on functionality.

**Thoughts:** Combining CSS variables and SCSS functions seems to not work. I might be able to figure out a workaround.
