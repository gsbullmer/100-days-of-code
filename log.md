# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Just getting the layout sort of how I want it.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle to figure out how to make my things display the way I think they should.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Primairly worked on functionality.

**Thoughts:** Combining CSS variables and SCSS functions seems to not work. I might be able to figure out a workaround.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Finished up styling and layout and worked on improved functionality in setting a random color. Also worked with `@keyframes` for the `shake` animation. The only functionality that's left is the Twitter integration.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is the devil! But I know I need to learn it.

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was trying to use Foundation's `reveal` component to display the Tweet form, but had some issues I couldn't figure out, and decided it wasn't worth the effort at this time.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to also learn React at the same time for this app. Plus, browser security is annoying.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 6: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've been struggling to figure out React. Not giving up just yet, but maybe using Code Pen isn't the best way to learn it. Also, I'm _learning_ how to use Code Pen, too. Figuring out how to do things when you don't have access to all the different files that the documentation wants you to have is frustrating.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 7: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp and learning React while doing so.

**Thoughts:** I've successfully coded over the weekend, which is where I thought I would have had trouble staying committed. This is HUGE for me. Also, React is starting to make sense to me now, after having spent some time going through the docs.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 8: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FreeCodeCamp projects to play with React.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang of what React can do and I'm starting to like it better than Angular. We'll see what I think of it when I use it for a meatier project in the near future.

**Link to work:** [React Playground][3]

### Day 9: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through the React: Getting Started and continued work on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Most of what I've learned about React has clicked and I feel confident to implement React into my Weather app. So far, so good.

**Link to work:** [React Playground][3], [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 10: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some excellent progress on the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp. Just about all of the framework and functionality is finished, just need to style it.

**Thoughts:** Still have a bit to go before fully understanding React, but I think I know enough to be dangerous.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 11: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All functionality of the Local Weather app from FreeCodeCamp is finished! I just need to stylize it.

**Thoughts:** Now that I'm trying to style the app, Flexbox rears its ugly, unexpected head. The fact that this is a React app and all my classes are assigned in my javascript file make matters even more tedious to get an idea of how the app is _actually_ structured.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 12: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on styling the app.

**Thoughts:** I have a hard time visualizing my app and then styling it to what I see in my head.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 13: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Missed a day, but I'm still working on styling the app.

**Thoughts:** Now I'm having a hard time visualizing my app. I really should have started with a layout, then made it dynamic. I instead designed to the data that was available. Now I feel like I'm constantly changing design descisions based on the content that should have been decided on earlier in the process. I'm marking this down as a "lesson learned."

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 14: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Yet more styling... I may never finish this app...

**Thoughts:** I've changed the layout _yet again,_ after starting at the mobile level and realized that it doesn't look very good at smaller sizes, _especially_ going between portrait and landscape. I fell like I've really botched the design of this app.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 15: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some different layout ideas.

**Thoughts:** Now that I've redone the layout of the app, I think it'll work on all screens much more effectively. _I need to move past this project!_

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 16: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finalized the layout (_finally!_). Need to do some final styling and a couple functionality things and I'm calling it done!

**Thoughts:** With the layout finished, I'm finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Now I've got to figure out how to get the off-canvas element to work. This project has made me realize I was using Foundation for the sake of using Foundation. Maybe I don't need it?

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 17: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the styling of app!

**Thoughts:** I've finished this project! Time to move on to other things.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 18: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Well, I thought I was finished with the app yesterday, but then found a few things to troubleshoot on mobile. Those are fixed now, and I'm extremely happy with the results.

**Thoughts:** I only _thought_ I finished the Local Weather app! I made some tweaks to make for a better experience on mobile. Now I'm moving on to the Wikipedia Search app tomorrow.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App][2]

### Day 19: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the Wikipedia Viewer app from FreeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts:** I'm having issues with CORS and the wikimedia API. I think CORS is implemented on the remote server, so there's nothing I can do about it on my end. I've seen where JSONP can be used instead, so I'm having to learn about that.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer][4]

### Day 20: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some great progress on the Wikipedia Viewer app. Also, I worked on a Python script to convert a JSON object to CSV for easier external use. No link as this is work-related.

**Thoughts:** I've gotten past the CORS issue by utilizing JSONP. Now I'm working on getting my app to look the way I want it to. I've run into an issue that I need to use the non-minified version of React to troubleshoot. Currently, it won't display search results anymore.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer][4]

### Day 21: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: App has all functionality working now. Attempted to impement GSAP for rich animation. It did not work.

**Thoughts:** GSAP isn't the easiest thing to use, since the documentation on it seems _off_, like its for AS3 instead of JS. Plus, most of the examples I've seen with getting it working in React are outdated to the point that they use depricated methods no longer available in the current version. Oh well. I will persevere.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer][4]

### Day 22: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break on the Wikipedia Viewer app and continued working on my Python script for work. This time, I added functionality to take that CSV and convert it back to JSON.

**Thoughts:** I really miss working in Python. This particular challenge involved reading in a CSV file, line by line, and converting it to a JSON object with nesting. Much more difficult to go backwards.

**Link to work:** No link today :(

### Day 23: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked primarily on adding some animation and styling to the Wikipedia Viewer app.

**Thoughts:** Today's pain point was making a "sticky" header without using Foundation's JS libraries. Felt a little silly to add JQuery and Foundation libraries just to make a sticky header.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer][4]

### Day 24: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Wikipedia Viewer app from FreeCodeCamp... for now.

**Thoughts:** All the functionality is there according to the User Stories. It's not the prettiest app in the world, but it does what it's supposed to do. I may revisit this later on.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer][4]

### Day 25: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Twitch.tv JSON API app from FreeCodeCamp. I started with the design first, which I feel is finished. I started working on some functionality.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how much more confident I feel about the design of this app than I have about previous ones right out of the gate. I didn't let functionality dictate my design, and instead I'll let design dictate function.

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv JSON API][5]

### Day 26: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on consuming the APIs for the Twitch.tv JSON API app.

**Thoughts:** Still love the design I've gone with. Now I'm trying to decide the best way to consume multiple APIs for a single display object. Is it better to make several calls per display object or hold the info in the parent container and just pass the JSON data to the display object?

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv JSON API][5]

### Day 27: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Twitch.tv JSON API app for FreeCodeCamp, plus added some bonus functionality.

**Thoughts:** I finished up all of the required User Stories and added a way for the user to add and remove thier own channels. **_BONUS!_** I think I can improve the user input by validating that the user they added exists before adding it to the list, but it does show up as _Not found_ as the status in the list. I did protect against empty input, though.

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv JSON API][5]

### Day 28: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tweaked some things in the Twitch.tv JSON API app.

**Thoughts:** I only _thought_ I was finished with this. After showing it to a collegue of mine, I noticed some unexpected behavior that I introduced with one of my previous changes. I also added some more styling to the tabs and input to make them a little more aesthetically pleasing. Lastly, I changed some components to be just functions for future optimization, and moved the status icon into its own component.

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv JSON API][5]

### Day 29: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Intermediate Algorithms in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** As much as I like the feeling of building things, I really enjoy coding algorithms. They feel like puzzles, and help me with critical and creative thinking.

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 30: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a bugfix for a VS Code theme I use that broke with the last update.

**Thoughts:** This wasn't so much a _programming_ day, but rather contributing to the open source community.

**Link to work:** [theme-dark-monokai][6]

### Day 31: February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Intermediate Algorithms in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Still enjoy working on algorithms! Some of them have been tricky, while others seemed too easy.

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 32: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Intermediate Algorithms in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Moar algorithms!!!

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 33: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Intermediate Algorithms in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Moar algorithms!!!

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 34: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Intermediate Algorithms in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Moving on to Advanced Algorithms!

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 35: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Advanced Algorithms section in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The first one took me a bit to figure out.

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 36: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Advanced Algorithms section in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These take significantly longer than the previous section...

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 37: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After a couple days away from coding, I'm back at it again with Advanced Algorithms section in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today's stumbling block was performing math on floating-point numbers, due to the fact that they can't be accurately represented in binary. My workaround was using a _lot_ of `Number(num.toFixed(2))` calculations. I might have overdone it, but it works.

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 38: February 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Advanced Algorithms today.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript seems to be lacking in built-in utility functions.

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 39: February 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Advanced Algorithms today.

**Thoughts:** Ah, dates...

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 40: February 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last of the Advanced Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts:** Next, on to actual projects. I'm ready for this!

**Link to work:** No link today.

### Day 41: February 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript Calculator project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Missed a few days, but I think I'm back on track. Got a basic framework in place and started working on laying out the React components.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Calculator][7]

## Day 42: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the JavaScript Calculator project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Missed another day... Did some more styling and started adding some functionality in React.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Calculator][7]

## Day 43: March 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the JavaScript Calculator project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** All of the basic functionality is working. Still need to really look at the design and I would like to add keypresses to make more user-friendly.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Calculator][7]

## Day 44: March 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished functionality of the JavaScript Calculator project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Functionality is finished, including keypresses. Started working on styling it a bit more. I think I'm going for a transparent glass-like design with animated pulses on hover and click.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Calculator][7]

## Day 45: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Missed a couple more days, but I've finished the JavaScript Calculator project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Finished styling it today and reworked the way keyboard events are handled.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Calculator][7]

## Day 46: March 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added work to my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Before moving on to the next FCC project, I decided that I should add some example work to my portfolio.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio][8]

## Day 47: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Pomodoro Clock project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Creating the pie chart is a bit more difficult with plain CSS that I would have thought.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock][9]

## Day 48: March 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Pomodoro Clock project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Worked on animation of the timer.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock][9]

## Day 49: March 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Canvas for the animation of the timer. Continued work on the Pomodoro Clock project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I didn't like the look of the CSS animations, so I converted it to Canvas. I like it a lot more! Of course, I had to _learn_ canvas, but it looks better. I still need to add functionality, which will probably be done in React.

**Link to work:** [Canvas Playground][10], [Pomodoro Clock][9]

## Day 50: March 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided to pick up my Arduino again and tinker with it.

**Thoughts:** Wow, its been a while since the last day... Taxes, work, baby, and just about everything else got in the way. Hopefully this will be the _longest_ break I take. Arduinos are fun!

**Link to work:** No link :(

## Day 51: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After a hiatus, continued work on the Pomodoro Clock project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After about a month away, I'm back! I picked up where I left off and started adding some more functionality to the timer. Still have to figure out how to start and stop the animation. Currently, it does some unexpected things and I'm not sure why.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock][9]

## Day 52: April 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on and completed most of the logic for the Pomodoro Clock project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm having trouble understanding why certain things are happening when using `requestAnimationFrames()`. It seems like its running multiple instances when the timer starts, causing a noticable lag in the page. Hopefully I'll get this figured out tomorrow.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock][9]

## Day 53: April 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pomodoro Clock project on FreeCodeCamp and started the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts:** Finally figured out why my code seemed to run multiple times, causing a slowdown. Added play/pause icons to the clock to know if it is currently running. I'm sure there is some other functionality I could add to make it even more usable, like browser notifications, but I'm walking away from this for now. I also started programming the functionality of a Tic Tac Toe game. Currently, you can place your markers and it will check to see if there is a winner. I'm dreading working on the AI for this game...

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock][9], [Tic Tac Toe][11]

## Day 54: April 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more logic for the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts:** Today I read a lot about the Minimax algorithm that seems to be the peferect AI system for Tic Tac Toe. Now I just have to figure out the best way to implement it.

**Link to work:** [Tic Tac Toe][11]

## Day 55: April 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to clone an array for the Tic Tac Toe project in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Copying one object to another seems more difficult than it should be. Why does JavaScript make certain things that should be easy to do so difficult?!

**Link to work:** [Tic Tac Toe][11]

## Day 56: May 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 7 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** I completely forgot about starting this at the beginning of the year! Thought I'd plug away at it again.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 57: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished days 8 and 9 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Learned some pretty cool things about the Dev Tools in Chrome. Also, made an interactive painting area in canvas. In other news, today is my 11th anniversary at MLink! Who knew?!

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 58: May 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 10 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** This project was interesting. I improved on the overall goal by making it work for both checking and unchecking multiple checkboxes.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 59: May 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 11 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** I made my own HTML video player!

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 60: May 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 12 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** I'm still trying to figure out some of the odd parts about JavaScript. Things like how you can't directly compare two arrays to see if the equal the same thing...

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 61: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished days 13 and 14 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Finally learned more about Object and Array references vs copies.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 62: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 15 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Learned about local storage and event delegation.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 63: May 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished days 16 and 17 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** CSS shadow fun and advanced array sorting!

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 64: May 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 18 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Counting time.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 65: May 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 19 of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Created a webcam viewer with a good starting point on creating filters. This was tough to do since I don't have a webcam...

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30][12]

## Day 66: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been working through the Packt Pub book _Learning Python_.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure why I feel the need to keep starting over with learning Python. I _do_ pick up a few new things each time, but I feel like I've been learning the basics of Python for the past two years now!
