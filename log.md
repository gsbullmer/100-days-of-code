# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Just getting the layout sort of how I want it.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle to figure out how to make my things display the way I think they should.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Primairly worked on functionality.

**Thoughts:** Combining CSS variables and SCSS functions seems to not work. I might be able to figure out a workaround.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Random Quote Generator app from Free Code Camp. Finished up styling and layout and worked on improved functionality in setting a random color. Also worked with `@keyframes` for the `shake` animation. The only functionality that's left is the Twitter integration.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is the devil! But I know I need to learn it.

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was trying to use Foundation's `reveal` component to display the Tweet form, but had some issues I couldn't figure out, and decided it wasn't worth the effort at this time.
